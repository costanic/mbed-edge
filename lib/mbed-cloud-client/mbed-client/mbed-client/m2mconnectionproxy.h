/**
 * The purpose of this class is to abstract the message protocol sent to/from
 * a proxy server in order to request that the proxy establish a tunnel to a
 * destination server.  The class requires an open socket already connected to
 * the proxy server, for example after a successful pal_connect(), through which
 * it sends command codes to the proxy server. Responses from the proxy server
 * must be provided to this class's receive_handler.  When the receive handler
 * returns success, the socket is considered to be connected to the destination
 * server and this class's work is complete. The socket may then be used as
 * normal to send and receive messages to/from the destination server.
